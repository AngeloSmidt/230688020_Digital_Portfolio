## Reflection
**Situation:**  
*This passage was given to show how your skills and interests can influence your career choices.*

**Task:**  
*I had to read a passage based on skills and interests and how they influence career choices then do a quiz based on what I read.*

**Action:**  
*I answered the questions based on my understanding of the terms and what I had to read before doing the quiz.*

**Result:**  
*I learned that it is important to choose a career that is based on what you like and what you can do rather than choosing a career that takes neither or only one of those factors into consideration, because it has a big impact on your experience on the job.*
